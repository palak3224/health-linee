                  What is CBD Oil?
                </h2>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  CBD oil is made by extracting cannabidiol (CBD) from the
                  cannabis plant and blending it with a carrier oil like coconut
                  oil or hemp seed oil. CBD is one of over 100 naturally
                  occurring compounds, known as cannabinoids, found in the{" "}
                  <em>Cannabis sativa</em> plant.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  Unlike tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) — the primary psychoactive
                  compound responsible for the "high" sensation — CBD is
                  non-psychoactive and does not produce intoxicating effects.
                </p>
                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                  Today, CBD is widely available in various forms, including
                  dietary supplements, bath soaks, beverages, and food products.

              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                CBD has been linked to pain relief since ancient times, dating
                back to 2900 B.C. It works by interacting with the body's{" "}
                <strong>endocannabinoid system (ECS)</strong>, which regulates
                functions like pain, sleep, and immune response.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                The body produces natural compounds called endocannabinoids,
                which bind to cannabinoid receptors to help manage pain. Studies
                suggest that CBD can influence this system by reducing
                inflammation, modulating receptor activity, and interacting with
                neurotransmitters.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
                Research also points to CBD’s potential for helping with chronic
                conditions like{" "}

              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-3">
