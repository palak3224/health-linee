                While CBD is generally well tolerated, it may cause side effects
                in some individuals, including:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside text-gray-700 mb-4">
                <li>Fatigue</li>
                <li>Diarrhea</li>
                <li>Changes in appetite</li>
                <li>Changes in weight</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                CBD may also interact with certain medications, especially those
                marked with a <strong>“grapefruit warning”</strong>. Both
                grapefruit and CBD interfere with enzymes that are essential for
                drug metabolism.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                A mouse study indicated that{" "}
                <strong>high doses of CBD could cause liver toxicity</strong>,
                but the doses used were exceptionally large and not
                representative of typical human consumption.

                While conclusive evidence is still evolving, many studies
                suggest that <strong>CBD offers significant promise</strong> in
                pain management, including chronic conditions like arthritis,
                migraines, and cancer-related pain.
              </p>

                CBD provides a natural alternative for pain relief{" "}
                <strong>without the risks of intoxication or dependency</strong>{" "}
                seen in some pharmaceutical drugs.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                If you are considering CBD for chronic pain,{" "}
                <strong>consult your healthcare provider</strong>
                to determine the right dosage and ensure it’s safe alongside
                your current medications.

                Is CBD Legal?
              </h2>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Under the <strong>2018 Farm Bill</strong>, hemp-derived CBD
                products with <strong>less than 0.3% THC</strong> are federally
                legal in the United States. However, CBD derived from marijuana,
                or products with higher THC concentrations, are still illegal
                federally but legal in some states.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                Always check <strong>local state laws</strong> before purchasing
                or traveling with CBD. Remember,
                <strong>
                  nonprescription CBD products are not FDA-approved
                </strong>
                , which means product quality, labeling accuracy, and dosage can
                vary greatly.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Make sure to purchase from reputable brands that provide{" "}
                <strong>third-party lab testing (COA)</strong> to ensure safety
                and accuracy.
