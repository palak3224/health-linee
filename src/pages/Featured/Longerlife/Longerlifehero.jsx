                The key to successfully adopting longevity practices is gradual implementation and consistency rather
                than perfection. Research shows that small, sustainable changes compound over time to create significant

                Longevity isn't about adding years to your life—it's about adding life to your years. The five
                science-backed strategies outlined here don't just extend lifespan; they improve healthspan, ensuring
                that your additional years are vibrant and fulfilling.

              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Remember, it's never too late to start. Research shows that even people who begin healthy practices in
                their 60s and 70s can still experience significant benefits. The best time to start was yesterday; the
                second-best time is today.
