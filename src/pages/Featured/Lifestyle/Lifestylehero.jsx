                The key to sustainable lifestyle change is personalization. What works for others might not work for
                you, and that's perfectly okay. The goal is to create a lifestyle that feels authentic and sustainable
                for your unique circumstances.

                <p className="text-gray-700 mb-4">
                  Rather than overhauling your entire life at once, focus on making small, consistent changes that
                  compound over time. This approach is more sustainable and less overwhelming.

                Creating a fulfilling lifestyle isn't about achieving perfection—it's about making intentional choices
                that align with your values and support your well-being. The five pillars outlined here provide a
                framework, but your unique lifestyle will be shaped by your personal preferences, circumstances, and
                goals.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-700">
                Remember that lifestyle design is an ongoing process, not a destination. Be patient with yourself,
                celebrate small wins, and stay open to adjusting your approach as you learn and grow. Your future self
                will thank you for the positive changes you make today.
